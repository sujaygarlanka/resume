\section{Summary}
A Software Engineer who has experience in robotics research through the development of action primitives using algorithmic and
distributed reinforcement learning approaches in simulation. Also, has 3 years of experience working with enterprise scale data
processing, developing APIs and building heavily used open source libraries for developers to interact with those APIs. Has full stack
development experience as well. \textbf{A U.S. citizen and authorized to work for any U.S. employer.}

\begin{tightemize}
\sectionsep
\item Developed functionality for the open-source robotics simulator, \href{https://behavior.stanford.edu/omnigibson/}{\underline{OmniGibson}}, built on Nvidia's IsaacSim simulation platform
\item Developed algorithmic action primitives that use privileged information in the simulator for navigation and manipulation (grasping, placing inside/on top, opening and closing for prismatic and revolute joints)
\item Developed action primitives using reinforcement learning. I helped create a distributed learning setup using gRPC and Docker. The setup includes a vector client environment running on a node for the RL learner that connects over the network to an $N$ number of OmniGibson containerized environments on other nodes.
\item Used a distributed setup to deploy RL experiments on a Slurm cluster with Stables Baselines 3 to train a policy and Weights and Biases to track policy and computational performance
\item Work used in publications BEHAVIOR-1K [1] and MoMaGen [2]

\descript{Software Engineer}
\location{August 2019 - June 2022 | Redwood City, CA}
\begin{tightemize}
\sectionsep
\item Co-lead the migration and re-architecture of Box API data collection and report generation of 3.8 to 114 billion rows of data daily from cron jobs to Apache Spark jobs. This decreases compute time per cluster and increases system fault tolerance.
\item Developed and maintained the open source Box SDKs in Github to allow developers to integrate with Box's API. Over 1.3 million API calls are made every minute through these SDKs.
\item Worked with the Java, .NET, Python, Node.js, iOS content, iOS preview SDKs and a CLI.
\item Worked on networking in the iOS content SDK by rewriting the network layer to reduce the SDK size by 70\%, reducing writes to disk and adding support for video streaming.
\item Helped lead the intern interview hiring process, implemented tooling to streamline the process and made the take home project more inclusive and convenient for students.
